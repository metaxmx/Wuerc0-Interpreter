WüRC0-Interpreter
=================

This program was created during my studies at the University Würzburg in a class about processors and hardware.
Our professor had created a simple assembly language for a model of a RISC processor calles WüRC0, which we used in class.

I created a simple interpreter with Java Swing to visualize the execution of programs in this assembly language.

I am aware that the program itself is not very useful without the assembly language, but it illustrates how to create a visual interpreter for such a language.
